	  Say Y here if you want to use the WWAN driver core. This driver
	  provides a common framework for WWAN drivers.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be

          MHI WWAN MBIM is a WWAN network driver for QCOM-based PCIe modems.
          It implements MBIM over MHI, for IP data aggregation and muxing.
          A default wwan0 network interface is created for MBIM data session
          ID 0. Additional links can be created via wwan rtnetlink type.

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
          called mhi_wwan_mbim.

	help
	  MHI WWAN CTRL allows QCOM-based PCIe modems to expose different modem
	  control protocols/ports to userspace, including AT, MBIM, QMI, DIAG
	  and FIREHOSE. These protocols can be accessed directly from userspace
	  (e.g. AT commands) or via libraries/tools (e.g. libmbim, libqmi,
	  libqcdm...).

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called mhi_wwan_ctrl.
